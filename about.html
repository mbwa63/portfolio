            <p>For the last 20 years I have worked in the training industry developing eLearning and training applications. Over that time I have worked with many authoring tools including Toolbook, Authorware and Flash. Recent development has taken me into the mobile world of tablet and phone devices. The prodigious effect these devices are having on the learning experience is both exciting and challenging. My focus is now helping organizations cross the bridge from Flash-based learning to e-learning that takes advantage of HTML5 technologies and responsive design.</p>
